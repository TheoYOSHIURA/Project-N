# Platform Fighting Game Project

## About

This is a game project I wanted to work on since I started to play "Super Smash Bros Ultimate" in 2019. The idea is to recreate a platform fighting game based on other titles like "Super Smash Bros", "Rivals of Aether", "Lethal League" and more with my personnal touch on certain game mechanics.
